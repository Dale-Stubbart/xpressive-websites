Vanilla Javascript Functions for easier building and maintenance of Expressive Websites
Easily create a curly apostrophe, easily indent, and much more. This is all down though the use of easily recognizable entities / shortcodes and html-like tags. Also include other useful javascript function - generic, for data, for forms, for graphics.
These Vanilla Javascript functions are written so that they can be easily maintained. No Arrow functions. Coding is fairly straightforward. Please keep it that way. It is much easier to maintain.
